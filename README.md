## Description
1. figure1  
   Raw temperature and pressure data obtained by sampling using DPGEN.
2. figure2  
   The raw data for the P-V of HG and CD are derived from calculations using DP (300K) and DFT (0K).
3. figure3  
   The raw data for the HG and CD dispersion relations are derived from calculations using DP (300K) and DFT (0K).
4. DPMD trajectory animation  
   Trajectory animation of DPMD under hydrostatic compression (1500 K, 85 GPa), inter-layer uniaxial compression (1500 K, 85 GPa), and intra-layer uniaxial compression (1500 K, 60 GPa).
